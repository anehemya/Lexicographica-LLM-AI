# Lexicographica

Lexicographica is a web application designed to be your one-stop shop for all things language-related. Built with Figma for design, React for interactivity, and CSS for styling, it seamlessly integrates Google Studio's AI (generative chat) technology.

**Design:**

The application features a clean and minimalist aesthetic.
The screen is divided into two sections:

Left side: A text input field where users can type their language-related questions.

Right side: A chat history window that displays the conversation log. User questions appear on the left, and the AI's responses appear on the right.

Two additional buttons are positioned strategically:

"Surprise Me!": This button generates a random language-related question for the user to explore. It encourages users to discover new aspects of language and keeps the interaction dynamic.

"Clear": This button allows users to erase the chat history and start fresh.

**Functionality:**

Users type their questions in the input field on the left.
Upon hitting enter or clicking a dedicated "Ask" button, the question is sent to the Google Studio AI.
The AI processes the question and generates a relevant and informative response that appears in the chat history on the right.
The "Surprise Me!" button, when clicked, fetches a random language-related question from an internal database or API and displays it in the input field. This injects an element of fun and discovery into the user experience.
The "Clear" button allows users to erase the chat history and start a new conversation with the AI. This ensures privacy and allows users to focus on specific inquiries.

**Target Audience:**

Writers and editors seeking grammar, vocabulary, and style advice.
Students and language learners looking for explanations and clarifications on various linguistic concepts.
Anyone curious about the intricacies of language, etymology, or cultural nuances.

**Benefits:**

Provides instant and accurate answers to a wide range of language-related questions.
Encourages exploration and learning through the "Surprise Me!" button.
Offers a clean and user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
Maintains privacy with the option to clear the chat history.
Overall, Lexicographica empowers users to become more confident and knowledgeable about language, making it a valuable tool for anyone with a curious mind or a professional need for linguistic expertise.
